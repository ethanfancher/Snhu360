The Weight Tracking App was developed to address the following user needs:

Tracking Daily Weight: Users wanted a convenient way to track their daily weight progress to monitor their health and fitness goals.

Setting Goal Weight: Users desired the ability to set a goal weight and track their progress towards achieving it.

Notification of Goal Achievement: Users wanted to receive notifications when they reached their goal weight as a motivation and milestone.

Screens and Features:

To support user needs and create a user-centered UI, the following screens and features were necessary:

Login/Registration Screen: A screen for users to log in or create a new account to access the app's features.

Weight Entry Screen: A screen with a date selector and weight input field for users to enter their daily weight.

Goal Setting Screen: A screen where users can set their goal weight.

Weight History Screen: A screen displaying a grid of all the daily weights and the dates they were entered.

Goal Achievement Notification: A mechanism by which the app notifies users when they reach their goal weight.

User-Centric UI Design:

The UI designs kept users in mind by following mobile app design best practices and guidelines. The designs were simple, intuitive, and focused on the core functionalities of weight tracking and goal setting. Clear labels, prominent input fields, and logical screen flows were implemented to enhance usability. The designs aimed to minimize cognitive load and provide a seamless experience for users to achieve their goals.

Coding Approach and Techniques:

The app was developed using programming languages and frameworks suitable for mobile application development, such as Java or Kotlin for Android development. Object-oriented programming principles and design patterns were utilized to ensure maintainability and scalability of the codebase. Modularization and separation of concerns were followed to promote code reusability.

Testing and Importance:

To ensure functional code, the app was thoroughly tested at different stages of development. Unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT) were performed. Testing is crucial to identify and fix any bugs or issues, ensuring that the app functions as intended and delivers a smooth user experience. It helps improve app reliability, user satisfaction, and overall quality.

Innovation and Overcoming Challenges:

During the app design and development process, one area of innovation was implementing a notification system to notify users upon achieving their goal weight. This feature required integrating with the device's notification system and setting up triggers based on user weight data. Innovative thinking and problem-solving were necessary to implement this functionality effectively.

Demonstrating Knowledge and Skills:

In the Weight Tracking App, I was particularly successful in demonstrating knowledge and skills in designing the user interface (UI) screens. By following mobile app UI design best practices, considering user needs, and maintaining a user-centered approach, the UI designs successfully addressed the goals of the app and provided an intuitive and visually appealing experience for the users.
